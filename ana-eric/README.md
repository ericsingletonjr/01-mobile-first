# Project Name

**Author**: Eric Singleton Jr and Ana Ortega
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
The purpose of building this application is to become familiar with responsive web design. We began wih a layout that was not responsive.



## Getting Started
We did this as a pair programming project, so we started by having Eric fork the repository. In order to be able to collaborate he had to grant me access to the repository so he did. We decided that I was going to be the driver first so after accepting his invitation to collaborate I cloned down a copy of the repository. I created a branch called "ana-eric" and we began following the instructions while making commits in between features.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
This application consists of only HTML and CSS. In order to organize our CSS we used the SMACSS approach which splits our CSS up into base, layout, and modules. We also utilized a library, which can be found in the icons.css file. This application design is responsive and will work with a mobile device or a desktop. The breakpoint before it changes to the mobile version is 640 px.
